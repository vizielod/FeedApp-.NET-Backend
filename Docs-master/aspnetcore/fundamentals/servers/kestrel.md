# Kestrel web server implementation in ASP.NET Core

By [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra), [Chris Ross](https://github.com/Tratcher), and [Stephen Halter](https://twitter.com/halter73)

Kestrel is a cross-platform [web server for ASP.NET Core](xref:fundamentals/servers/index). Kestrel is the web server that's included by default in ASP.NET Core project templates.

Kestrel supports the following features:

* HTTPS
* Opaque upgrade used to enable [WebSockets](https://github.com/aspnet/websockets)
* Unix sockets for high performance behind Nginx

Kestrel is supported on all platforms and versions that .NET Core supports.

## When to use Kestrel with a reverse proxy

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x)

You can use Kestrel by itself or with a *reverse proxy server*, such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache. A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the Internet and forwards them to Kestrel after some preliminary handling.

![Kestrel communicates directly with the Internet without a reverse proxy server](kestrel/_static/kestrel-to-internet2.png)

![Kestrel communicates indirectly with the Internet through a reverse proxy server, such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache](kestrel/_static/kestrel-to-internet.png)

Either configuration&mdash;with or without a reverse proxy server&mdash;is a valid and supported hosting configuration for ASP.NET Core 2.0 or later apps.

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x)

If an app accepts requests only from an internal network, Kestrel can be used directly as the app's server.

![Kestrel communicates directly with your internal network](kestrel/_static/kestrel-to-internal.png)

If you expose your app to the Internet, use IIS, Nginx, or Apache as a *reverse proxy server*. A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the Internet and forwards them to Kestrel after some preliminary handling.

![Kestrel communicates indirectly with the Internet through a reverse proxy server, such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache](kestrel/_static/kestrel-to-internet.png)

A reverse proxy is required for edge deployments (exposed to traffic from the Internet) for security reasons. The 1.x versions of Kestrel don't have a full complement of defenses against attacks, such as appropriate timeouts, size limits, and concurrent connection limits.

---

A reverse proxy scenario exists when there are multiple apps that share the same IP and port running on a single server. Kestrel doesn't support this scenario because Kestrel doesn't support sharing the same IP and port among multiple processes. When Kestrel is configured to listen on a port, Kestrel handles all of the traffic for that port regardless of requests' host header. A reverse proxy that can share ports has the ability to forward requests to Kestrel on a unique IP and port.

Even if a reverse proxy server isn't required, using a reverse proxy server might be a good choice:

* It can limit the exposed public surface area of the apps that it hosts.
* It provides an additional layer of configuration and defense.
* It might integrate better with existing infrastructure.
* It simplifies load balancing and SSL configuration. Only the reverse proxy server requires an SSL certificate, and that server can communicate with your app servers on the internal network using plain HTTP.

> [!WARNING]
> If not using a reverse proxy with host filtering enabled, [host filtering](#host-filtering) must be enabled.

## How to use Kestrel in ASP.NET Core apps

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x/)

The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel/) package is included in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.All metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage).

ASP.NET Core project templates use Kestrel by default. In *Program.cs*, the template code calls [CreateDefaultBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.webhost.createdefaultbuilder), which calls [UseKestrel](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderkestrelextensions.usekestrel) behind the scenes.

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_DefaultBuilder&highlight=7)]

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x/)

Install the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel/) NuGet package.

Call the [UseKestrel](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderkestrelextensions.usekestrel?view=aspnetcore-1.1) extension method on [WebHostBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilder?view=aspnetcore-1.1) in the `Main` method, specifying any [Kestrel options](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.kestrelserveroptions?view=aspnetcore-1.1) required, as shown in the next section.

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/1.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_Main&highlight=13-19)]

### Kestrel options

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x/)

The Kestrel web server has constraint configuration options that are especially useful in Internet-facing deployments. A few important limits that can be customized:

* Maximum client connections
* Maximum request body size
* Minimum request body data rate

Set these and other constraints on the [Limits](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.limits) property of the [KestrelServerOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions) class. The `Limits` property holds an instance of the [KestrelServerLimits](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserverlimits) class.

**Maximum client connections**

[MaxConcurrentConnections](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserverlimits.maxconcurrentconnections)  
[MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserverlimits.maxconcurrentupgradedconnections)

The maximum number of concurrent open TCP connections can be set for the entire app with the following code:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_Limits&highlight=3)]

There's a separate limit for connections that have been upgraded from HTTP or HTTPS to another protocol (for example, on a WebSockets request). After a connection is upgraded, it isn't counted against the `MaxConcurrentConnections` limit.

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_Limits&highlight=4)]

The maximum number of connections is unlimited (null) by default.

**Maximum request body size**

[MaxRequestBodySize](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserverlimits.maxrequestbodysize)

The default maximum request body size is 30,000,000 bytes, which is approximately 28.6 MB.

The recommended approach to override the limit in an ASP.NET Core MVC app is to use the [RequestSizeLimit](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.requestsizelimitattribute) attribute on an action method:

```csharp
[RequestSizeLimit(100000000)]
public IActionResult MyActionMethod()
```

Here's an example that shows how to configure the constraint for the app on every request:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_Limits&highlight=5)]

You can override the setting on a specific request in middleware:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet_Limits&highlight=3-4)]

An exception is thrown if you attempt to configure the limit on a request after the app has started to read the request. There's an `IsReadOnly` property that indicates if the `MaxRequestBodySize` property is in read-only state, meaning it's too late to configure the limit.

**Minimum request body data rate**

[MinRequestBodyDataRate](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserverlimits.minrequestbodydatarate)  
[MinResponseDataRate](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserverlimits.minresponsedatarate)

Kestrel checks every second if data is arriving at the specified rate in bytes/second. If the rate drops below the minimum, the connection is timed out. The grace period is the amount of time that Kestrel gives the client to increase its send rate up to the minimum; the rate isn't checked during that time. The grace period helps avoid dropping connections that are initially sending data at a slow rate due to TCP slow-start.

The default minimum rate is 240 bytes/second with a 5 second grace period.

A minimum rate also applies to the response. The code to set the request limit and the response limit is the same except for having `RequestBody` or `Response` in the property and interface names.

Here's an example that shows how to configure the minimum data rates in *Program.cs*:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_Limits&highlight=6-7)]

You can configure the rates per request in middleware:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet_Limits&highlight=5-8)]

### Endpoint configuration

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x/)

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"
By default, ASP.NET Core binds to `http://localhost:5000`. Call [Listen](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.listen) or [ListenUnixSocket](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.listenunixsocket) methods on [KestrelServerOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions) to configure URL prefixes and ports for Kestrel. `UseUrls`, the `--urls` command-line argument, `urls` host configuration key, and the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable also work but have the limitations noted later in this section.

The `urls` host configuration key must come from the host configuration, not the app configuration. Adding a `urls` key and value to *appsettings.json* doesn't affect host configuration because the host is completely initialized by the time the configuration is read from the configuration file. However, a `urls` key in *appsettings.json* can be used with [UseConfiguration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.hostingabstractionswebhostbuilderextensions.useconfiguration) on the host builder to configure the host:

```csharp
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("appSettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
    .Build();

var host = new WebHostBuilder()
    .UseKestrel()
    .UseConfiguration(config)
    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .UseStartup<Startup>()
    .Build();
```

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

By default, ASP.NET Core binds to:

* `http://localhost:5000`
* `https://localhost:5001` (when a local development certificate is present)

A development certificate is created:

* When the [.NET Core SDK](/dotnet/core/sdk) is installed.
* The [dev-certs tool](https://github.com/aspnet/DotNetTools/tree/dev/src/dotnet-dev-certs) is used to create a certificate.

Some browsers require that you grant explicit permission to the browser to trust the local development certificate.

ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later project templates configure apps to run on HTTPS by default and include [HTTPS redirection and HSTS support](xref:security/enforcing-ssl).

Call [Listen](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.listen) or [ListenUnixSocket](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.listenunixsocket) methods on [KestrelServerOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions) to configure URL prefixes and ports for Kestrel.

`UseUrls`, the `--urls` command-line argument, `urls` host configuration key, and the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable also work but have the limitations noted later in this section (a default certificate must be available for HTTPS endpoint configuration).

ASP.NET Core 2.1 `KestrelServerOptions` configuration:

**ConfigureEndpointDefaults(Action&lt;ListenOptions&gt;)**  
Specifies a configuration `Action` to run for each specified endpoint. Calling `ConfigureEndpointDefaults` multiple times replaces prior `Action`s with the last `Action` specified.

**ConfigureHttpsDefaults(Action&lt;HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions&gt;)**  
Specifies a configuration `Action` to run for each HTTPS endpoint. Calling `ConfigureHttpsDefaults` multiple times replaces prior `Action`s with the last `Action` specified.

**Configure(IConfiguration)**  
Creates a configuration loader for setting up Kestrel that takes an [IConfiguration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.iconfiguration) as input. The configuration must be scoped to the configuration section for Kestrel.

**ListenOptions.UseHttps**  
Configure Kestrel to use HTTPS.

`ListenOptions.UseHttps` extensions:

* `UseHttps` &ndash; Configure Kestrel to use HTTPS with the default certificate. Throws an exception if no default certificate is configured.
* `UseHttps(string fileName)`
* `UseHttps(string fileName, string password)`
* `UseHttps(string fileName, string password, Action<HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions> configureOptions)`
* `UseHttps(StoreName storeName, string subject)`
* `UseHttps(StoreName storeName, string subject, bool allowInvalid)`
* `UseHttps(StoreName storeName, string subject, bool allowInvalid, StoreLocation location)`
* `UseHttps(StoreName storeName, string subject, bool allowInvalid, StoreLocation location, Action<HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions> configureOptions)`
* `UseHttps(X509Certificate2 serverCertificate)`
* `UseHttps(X509Certificate2 serverCertificate, Action<HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions> configureOptions)`
* `UseHttps(Action<HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions> configureOptions)`

`ListenOptions.UseHttps` parameters:

* `filename` is the path and file name of a certificate file, relative to the directory that contains the app's content files.
* `password` is the password required to access the X.509 certificate data.
* `configureOptions` is an `Action` to configure the `HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions`. Returns the `ListenOptions`.
* `storeName` is the certificate store from which to load the certificate.
* `subject` is the subject name for the certificate.
* `allowInvalid` indicates if invalid certificates should be considered, such as self-signed certificates.
* `location` is the store location to load the certificate from.
* `serverCertificate` is the X.509 certificate.

In production, HTTPS must be explicitly configured. At a minimum, a default certificate must be provided.

Supported configurations described next:

* No configuration
* Replace the default certificate from configuration
* Change the defaults in code

*No configuration*

Kestrel listens on `http://localhost:5000` and `https://localhost:5001` (if a default cert is available).

Specify URLs using the:

* `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable.
* `--urls` command-line argument.
* `urls` host configuration key.
* `UseUrls` extension method.

For more information, see [Server URLs](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#server-urls) and [Override configuration](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#override-configuration).

The value provided using these approaches can be one or more HTTP and HTTPS endpoints (HTTPS if a default cert is available). Configure the value as a semicolon-separated list (for example, `"Urls": "http://localhost:8000;http://localhost:8001"`).

*Replace the default certificate from configuration*

[WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.webhost.createdefaultbuilder) calls `serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection("Kestrel"))` by default to load Kestrel configuration. A default HTTPS app settings configuration schema is available for Kestrel. Configure multiple endpoints, including the URLs and the certificates to use, either from a file on disk or from a certificate store.

In the following *appsettings.json* example:

* Set **AllowInvalid** to `true` to permit the use of invalid certificates (for example, self-signed certificates).
* Any HTTPS endpoint that doesn't specify a certificate (**HttpsDefaultCert** in the example that follows) falls back to the cert defined under **Certificates** > **Default** or the development certificate.

```json
{
"Kestrel": {
  "EndPoints": {
    "Http": {
      "Url": "http://localhost:5000"
    },

    "HttpsInlineCertFile": {
      "Url": "https://localhost:5001",
      "Certificate": {
        "Path": "<path to .pfx file>",
        "Password": "<certificate password>"
      }
    },

    "HttpsInlineCertStore": {
      "Url": "https://localhost:5002",
      "Certificate": {
        "Subject": "<subject; required>",
        "Store": "<certificate store; defaults to My>",
        "Location": "<location; defaults to CurrentUser>",
        "AllowInvalid": "<true or false; defaults to false>"
      }
    },

    "HttpsDefaultCert": {
      "Url": "https://localhost:5003"
    },

    "Https": {
      "Url": "https://*:5004",
      "Certificate": {
      "Path": "<path to .pfx file>",
      "Password": "<certificate password>"
      }
    }
    },
    "Certificates": {
      "Default": {
        "Path": "<path to .pfx file>",
        "Password": "<certificate password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An alternative to using **Path** and **Password** for any certificate node is to specify the certificate using certificate store fields. For example, the **Certificates** > **Default** certificate can be specified as:

```json
"Default": {
  "Subject": "<subject; required>",
  "Store": "<cert store; defaults to My>",
  "Location": "<location; defaults to CurrentUser>",
  "AllowInvalid": "<true or false; defaults to false>"
}
```

Schema notes:

* Endpoints names are case-insensitive. For example, `HTTPS` and `Https` are valid.
* The `Url` parameter is required for each endpoint. The format for this parameter is the same as the top-level `Urls` configuration parameter except that it's limited to a single value.
* These endpoints replace those defined in the top-level `Urls` configuration rather than adding to them. Endpoints defined in code via `Listen` are cumulative with the endpoints defined in the configuration section.
* The `Certificate` section is optional. If the `Certificate` section isn't specified, the defaults defined in earlier scenarios are used. If no defaults are available, the server throws an exception and fails to start.
* The `Certificate` section supports both **Path**&ndash;**Password** and **Subject**&ndash;**Store** certificates.
* Any number of endpoints may be defined in this way so long as they don't cause port conflicts.
* `serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection("Kestrel"))` returns a `KestrelConfigurationLoader` with an `.Endpoint(string name, options => { })` method that can be used to supplement a configured endpoint's settings:

  ```csharp
  serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection("Kestrel"))
      .Endpoint("HTTPS", opt =>
      {
          opt.HttpsOptions.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12;
      });
  ```

  You can also directly access `KestrelServerOptions.ConfigurationLoader` to keep iterating on the existing loader, such as the one provided by `WebHost.CreatedDeafaultBuilder`.

* The configuration section for each endpoint is a available on the options in the `Endpoint` method so that custom settings may be read.
* Multiple configurations may be loaded by calling `serverOptions.Configure(context.Configuration.GetSection("Kestrel"))` again with another section. Only the last configuration is used, unless `Load` is explicitly called on prior instances. The metapackage doesn't call `Load` so that its default configuration section may be replaced.
* `KestrelConfigurationLoader` mirrors the `Listen` family of APIs from `KestrelServerOptions` as `Endpoint` overloads, so code and config endpoints may be configured in the same place. These overloads don't use names and only consume default settings from configuration.

*Change the defaults in code*

`ConfigureEndpointDefaults` and `ConfigureHttpsDefaults` can be used to change default settings for `ListenOptions` and `HttpsConnectionAdapterOptions`, including overriding the default certificate specified in the prior scenario. `ConfigureEndpointDefaults` and `ConfigureHttpsDefaults` should be called before any endpoints are configured.

```csharp
options.ConfigureEndpointDefaults(opt =>
{
    opt.NoDelay = true;
});

options.ConfigureHttpsDefaults(httpsOptions =>
{
    httpsOptions.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12;
});
```

*Kestrel support for SNI*

[Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3) can be used to host multiple domains on the same IP address and port. For SNI to function, the client sends the host name for the secure session to the server during the TLS handshake so that the server can provide the correct certificate. The client uses the furnished certificate for encrypted communication with the server during the secure session that follows the TLS handshake.

Kestrel supports SNI via the `ServerCertificateSelector` callback. The callback is invoked once per connection to allow the app to inspect the host name and select the appropriate certificate.

SNI support requires running on target framework `netcoreapp2.1`. On `netcoreapp2.0` and `net461`, the callback is invoked but the `name` is always `null`. The `name` is also `null` if the client doesn't provide the host name parameter in the TLS handshake.

```csharp
WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder()
    .UseKestrel((context, options) =>
    {
        options.ListenAnyIP(5005, listenOptions =>
        {
            listenOptions.UseHttps(httpsOptions =>
            {
                var localhostCert = CertificateLoader.LoadFromStoreCert(
                    "localhost", "My", StoreLocation.CurrentUser, 
                    allowInvalid: true);
                var exampleCert = CertificateLoader.LoadFromStoreCert(
                    "example.com", "My", StoreLocation.CurrentUser, 
                    allowInvalid: true);
                var subExampleCert = CertificateLoader.LoadFromStoreCert(
                    "sub.example.com", "My", StoreLocation.CurrentUser, 
                    allowInvalid: true);
                var certs = new Dictionary(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
                certs["localhost"] = localhostCert;
                certs["example.com"] = exampleCert;
                certs["sub.example.com"] = subExampleCert;

                httpsOptions.ServerCertificateSelector = (connectionContext, name) =>
                {
                    if (name != null && certs.TryGetValue(name, out var cert))
                    {
                        return cert;
                    }

                    return exampleCert;
                };
            });
        });
    });
```

**Bind to a TCP socket**

The [Listen](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.listen) method binds to a TCP socket, and an options lambda permits SSL certificate configuration:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_TCPSocket&highlight=9-16)]

The example configures SSL for an endpoint with [ListenOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.listenoptions). Use the same API to configure other Kestrel settings for specific endpoints.

[!INCLUDE [How to make an X.509 cert](~/includes/make-x509-cert.md)]

**Bind to a Unix socket**

Listen on a Unix socket with [ListenUnixSocket](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions.listenunixsocket) for improved performance with Nginx, as shown in this example:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Program.cs?name=snippet_UnixSocket)]

**Port 0**

When the port number `0` is specified, Kestrel dynamically binds to an available port. The following example shows how to determine which port Kestrel actually bound at runtime:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/samples/2.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet_Port0&highlight=3)]

When the app is run, the console window output indicates the dynamic port where the app can be reached:

```console
Now listening on: http://127.0.0.1:48508
```

**UseUrls, --urls command-line argument, urls host configuration key, and ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable limitations**

Configure endpoints with the following approaches:

* [UseUrls](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.hostingabstractionswebhostbuilderextensions.useurls)
* `--urls` command-line argument
* `urls` host configuration key
* `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable

These methods are useful for making code work with servers other than Kestrel. However, be aware of these limitations:

* SSL can't be used with these approaches unless a default certificate is provided in the HTTPS endpoint configuration (for example, using `KestrelServerOptions` configuration or a configuration file as shown earlier in this topic).
* When both the `Listen` and `UseUrls` approaches are used simultaneously, the `Listen` endpoints override the `UseUrls` endpoints.

**IIS endpoint configuration**

When using IIS, the URL bindings for IIS override bindings are set by either `Listen` or `UseUrls`. For more information, see the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:fundamentals/servers/aspnet-core-module) topic.

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x/)

By default, ASP.NET Core binds to `http://localhost:5000`. Configure URL prefixes and ports for Kestrel using:

* [UseUrls](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.hostingabstractionswebhostbuilderextensions.useurls?view=aspnetcore-1.1) extension method
* `--urls` command-line argument
* `urls` host configuration key
* ASP.NET Core configuration system, including `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable

For more information on these methods, see [Hosting](xref:fundamentals/host/index).

**IIS endpoint configuration**

When using IIS, the URL bindings for IIS override bindings set by `UseUrls`. For more information, see the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:fundamentals/servers/aspnet-core-module) topic.

## Transport configuration

With the release of ASP.NET Core 2.1, Kestrel's default transport is no longer based on Libuv but instead based on managed sockets. This is a breaking change for ASP.NET Core 2.0 apps upgrading to 2.1 that call [WebHostBuilderLibuvExtensions.UseLibuv](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.webhostbuilderlibuvextensions.uselibuv) and depend on either of the following packages:

* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel/) (direct package reference)
* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/)

For ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later projects that use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage and require the use of Libuv:

* Add a dependency for the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv/) package to the app's project file:

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv"

### URL prefixes

When using `UseUrls`, `--urls` command-line argument, `urls` host configuration key, or `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable, the URL prefixes can be in any of the following formats.

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x/)

Only HTTP URL prefixes are valid. Kestrel doesn't support SSL when configuring URL bindings using `UseUrls`.

* IPv4 address with port number

  ```
  http://65.55.39.10:80/
  ```

  `0.0.0.0` is a special case that binds to all IPv4 addresses.

* IPv6 address with port number

  ```
  http://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:4137:270a]:80/
  ```

  `[::]` is the IPv6 equivalent of IPv4 `0.0.0.0`.

* Host name with port number

  ```
  http://contoso.com:80/
  http://*:80/
  ```

  Host names, `*`, and `+`, aren't special. Anything not recognized as a valid IP address or `localhost` binds to all IPv4 and IPv6 IPs. To bind different host names to different ASP.NET Core apps on the same port, use [HTTP.sys](xref:fundamentals/servers/httpsys) or a reverse proxy server, such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache.

  > [!WARNING]
  > If not using a reverse proxy with host filtering enabled, enable [host filtering](#host-filtering).

* Host `localhost` name with port number or loopback IP with port number

  ```
  http://localhost:5000/
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  http://[::1]:5000/
  ```

  When `localhost` is specified, Kestrel attempts to bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback interfaces. If the requested port is in use by another service on either loopback interface, Kestrel fails to start. If either loopback interface is unavailable for any other reason (most commonly because IPv6 isn't supported), Kestrel logs a warning.

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x/)

* IPv4 address with port number

  ```
  http://65.55.39.10:80/
  https://65.55.39.10:443/
  ```

  `0.0.0.0` is a special case that binds to all IPv4 addresses.

* IPv6 address with port number

  ```
  http://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:4137:270a]:80/
  https://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:4137:270a]:443/
  ```

  `[::]` is the IPv6 equivalent of IPv4 `0.0.0.0`.

* Host name with port number

  ```
  http://contoso.com:80/
  http://*:80/
  https://contoso.com:443/
  https://*:443/
  ```

  Host names, `*`, and `+` aren't special. Anything that isn't a recognized IP address or `localhost` binds to all IPv4 and IPv6 IPs. To bind different host names to different ASP.NET Core apps on the same port, use [WebListener](xref:fundamentals/servers/weblistener) or a reverse proxy server, such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache.

* Host `localhost` name with port number or loopback IP with port number

  ```
  http://localhost:5000/
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  http://[::1]:5000/
  ```

  When `localhost` is specified, Kestrel attempts to bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback interfaces. If the requested port is in use by another service on either loopback interface, Kestrel fails to start. If either loopback interface is unavailable for any other reason (most commonly because IPv6 isn't supported), Kestrel logs a warning.

* Unix socket

  ```
  http://unix:/run/dan-live.sock
  ```

**Port 0**

When the port number is `0` is specified, Kestrel dynamically binds to an available port. Binding to port `0` is allowed for any host name or IP except for `localhost`.

When the app is run, the console window output indicates the dynamic port where the app can be reached:

```console
Now listening on: http://127.0.0.1:48508
```

**URL prefixes for SSL**

If calling the `UseHttps` extension method, be sure to include URL prefixes with `https:`:

```csharp
var host = new WebHostBuilder()
    .UseKestrel(options =>
    {
        options.UseHttps("testCert.pfx", "testPassword");
    })
   .UseUrls("http://localhost:5000", "https://localhost:5001")
   .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
   .UseStartup<Startup>()
   .Build();
```

> [!NOTE]
> HTTPS and HTTP can't be hosted on the same port.

## Host filtering

While Kestrel supports configuration based on prefixes such as `http://example.com:5000`, Kestrel largely ignores the host name. Host `localhost` is a special case used for binding to loopback addresses. Any host other than an explicit IP address binds to all public IP addresses. None of this information is used to validate request `Host` headers.

There are two workarounds:

* Host behind a reverse proxy with host header filtering. This was the only supported scenario for Kestrel in ASP.NET Core 1.x.
* Use a middleware to filter requests by the `Host` header. A sample middleware follows:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
using Microsoft.Net.Http.Headers;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

// A normal middleware would provide an options type, config binding, extension methods, etc..
// This intentionally does all of the work inside of the middleware so it can be
// easily copy-pasted into docs and other projects.
public class HostFilteringMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IList<string> _hosts;
    private readonly ILogger<HostFilteringMiddleware> _logger;

    public HostFilteringMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IConfiguration config, ILogger<HostFilteringMiddleware> logger)
    {
        if (config == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(config));
        }

        _next = next ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(next));
        _logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));

        // A semicolon separated list of host names without the port numbers.
        // IPv6 addresses must use the bounding brackets and be in their normalized form.
        _hosts = config["AllowedHosts"]?.Split(new[] { ';' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
        if (_hosts == null || _hosts.Count == 0)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("No configuration entry found for AllowedHosts.");
        }
    }

    public Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (!ValidateHost(context))
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 400;
            _logger.LogDebug("Request rejected due to incorrect Host header.");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        return _next(context);
    }

    // This does not duplicate format validations that are expected to be performed by the host.
    private bool ValidateHost(HttpContext context)
    {
        StringSegment host = context.Request.Headers[HeaderNames.Host].ToString().Trim();

        if (StringSegment.IsNullOrEmpty(host))
        {
            // Http/1.0 does not require the Host header.
            // Http/1.1 requires the header but the value may be empty.
            return true;
        }

        // Drop the port

        var colonIndex = host.LastIndexOf(':');

        // IPv6 special case
        if (host.StartsWith("[", StringComparison.Ordinal))
        {
            var endBracketIndex = host.IndexOf(']');
            if (endBracketIndex < 0)
            {
                // Invalid format
                return false;
            }
            if (colonIndex < endBracketIndex)
            {
                // No port, just the IPv6 Host
                colonIndex = -1;
            }
        }

        if (colonIndex > 0)
        {
            host = host.Subsegment(0, colonIndex);
        }

        foreach (var allowedHost in _hosts)
        {
            if (StringSegment.Equals(allowedHost, host, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            {
                return true;
            }

            // Sub-domain wildcards: *.example.com
            if (allowedHost.StartsWith("*.", StringComparison.Ordinal) && host.Length >= allowedHost.Length)
            {
                // .example.com
                var allowedRoot = new StringSegment(allowedHost, 1, allowedHost.Length - 1);

                var hostRoot = host.Subsegment(host.Length - allowedRoot.Length, allowedRoot.Length);
                if (hostRoot.Equals(allowedRoot, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

Register the preceding `HostFilteringMiddleware` in `Startup.Configure`. Note that the [ordering of middleware registration](xref:fundamentals/middleware/index#ordering) is important. Registration should occur immediately after Diagnostic Middleware registration (for example, `app.UseExceptionHandler`).

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        app.UseBrowserLink();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    }

    app.UseMiddleware<HostFilteringMiddleware>();

    app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute();
}
```

The preceding middleware expects an `AllowedHosts` key in *appsettings.\<EnvironmentName>.json*. This key's value is a semicolon-delimited list of host names without the port numbers. Include the `AllowedHosts` key-value pair in *appsettings.Production.json*:

```json
{
  "AllowedHosts": "example.com"
}
```

*appsettings.Development.json* (localhost configuration file):

```json
{
  "AllowedHosts": "localhost"
}
```
