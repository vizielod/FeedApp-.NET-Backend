# Use the Single Page Application templates with ASP.NET Core

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

> [!NOTE]
> The released .NET Core 2.0.x SDK includes older project templates for Angular, React, and React with Redux. This documentation isn't about those older project templates. This documentation is for the latest Angular, React, and React with Redux templates, which can be installed manually into ASP.NET Core 2.0. The templates are included by default with ASP.NET Core 2.1.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), version 6 or later

## Installation
