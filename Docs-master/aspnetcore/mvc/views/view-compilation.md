# Razor file compilation in ASP.NET Core

A Razor file is compiled at runtime, when the associated MVC view is invoked. Build-time Razor file publishing is unsupported. Razor files can optionally be compiled at publish time and deployed with the app&mdash;using the precompilation tool.

A Razor file is compiled at runtime, when the associated Razor Page or MVC view is invoked. Razor files are compiled at both build and publish time using the [Razor SDK](xref:mvc/razor-pages/sdk).

## Precompilation considerations

The following are side effects of precompiling Razor files:

* A smaller published bundle
* A faster startup time
* You can't edit Razor files&mdash;the associated content is absent from the published bundle.

## Deploy precompiled files

Build- and publish-time compilation of Razor files is enabled by default by the Razor SDK. Editing Razor files after they're updated is supported at build time. By default, only the compiled *Views.dll* and no *.cshtml* files are deployed with your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Razor SDK is effective only when no precompilation-specific properties are set in the project file. For instance, setting the *.csproj* file's `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` property to `true` disables the Razor SDK.

If your project targets .NET Framework, install the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation/) NuGet package:

[!code-xml[](view-compilation/sample/DotNetFrameworkProject.csproj?name=snippet_ViewCompilationPackage)]

If your project targets .NET Core, no changes are necessary.

The ASP.NET Core 2.x project templates implicitly set the `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` property to `true` by default. Consequently, this element can be safely removed from the *.csproj* file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Razor file precompilation is unavailable when performing a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) in ASP.NET Core 2.0.

Set the `MvcRazorCompileOnPublish` property to `true`, and install the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.ViewCompilation/) NuGet package. The following *.csproj* sample highlights these settings:

Prepare the app for a [framework-dependent deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd) with the [.NET Core CLI publish command](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish). For example, execute the following command at the project root:

```console
dotnet publish -c Release
```

A *<project_name>.PrecompiledViews.dll* file, containing the compiled Razor files, is produced when precompilation succeeds. For example, the screenshot below depicts the contents of *Index.cshtml* within *WebApplication1.PrecompiledViews.dll*:
