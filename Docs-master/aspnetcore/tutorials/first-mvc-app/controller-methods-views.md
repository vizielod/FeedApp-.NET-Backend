# Controller methods and views in ASP.NET Core

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

We have a good start to the movie app, but the presentation isn't ideal. We don't want to see the time (12:00:00 AM in the image below) and **ReleaseDate** should be two words.

![Index view: Release Date is one word (no space) and every movie release date shows a time of 12 AM](working-with-sql/_static/m55.png)

Open the *Models/Movie.cs* file and add the highlighted lines shown below:

[!code-csharp[](start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie/Models/MovieDateWithExtraUsings.cs?name=snippet_1&highlight=13-14)]

Right click on a red squiggly line **> Quick Actions and Refactorings**.

  ![Contextual menu shows **> Quick Actions and Refactorings**.](controller-methods-views/_static/qa.png)


Tap `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;`

  ![using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations at top of list](controller-methods-views/_static/da.png)

  Visual studio adds `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;`.

Let's remove the `using` statements that are not needed. They show up by default in a light grey font. Right click anywhere in the *Movie.cs* file **> Remove and Sort Usings**.

The updated code:

[!code-csharp[](./start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie/Models/MovieDate.cs?name=snippet_1)]

<!-- include start -->

[!INCLUDE [adding-model](../../includes/mvc-intro/controller-methods-views.md)]

> [!div class="step-by-step"]
> [Previous](working-with-sql.md)
> [Next](search.md)
