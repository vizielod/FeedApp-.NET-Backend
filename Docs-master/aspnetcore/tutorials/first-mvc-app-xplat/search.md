[!INCLUDE [adding-model](../../includes/mvc-intro/search1.md)]

Note: SQLlite is case sensitive, so you'll need to search for "Ghost" and not "ghost".

[!INCLUDE [adding-model](../../includes/mvc-intro/search2.md)]

Change the `<form>` tag in the *Views\movie\Index.cshtml* Razor view to specify `method="get"`:

```html
<form asp-controller="Movies" asp-action="Index" method="get">
```

[!INCLUDE [adding-model](../../includes/mvc-intro/search3.md)]

> [!div class="step-by-step"]
> [Previous - Controller methods and views](controller-methods-views.md)
> [Next - Add a field](new-field.md)
