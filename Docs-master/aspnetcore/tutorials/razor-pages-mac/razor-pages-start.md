# Get started with Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core on macOS with Visual Studio for Mac

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This tutorial teaches the basics of building an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app. We recommend you review [Introduction to Razor Pages](xref:mvc/razor-pages/index) before starting this tutorial. Razor Pages is the recommended way to build UI for web applications in ASP.NET Core.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [](~/includes/net-core-prereqs-macos.md)]

## Create a Razor web app

From a terminal, run the following commands:

```console
dotnet new razor -o RazorPagesMovie
cd RazorPagesMovie
dotnet run
```

The preceding commands use the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) to create and run a Razor Pages project. Open a browser to http://localhost:5000 to view the application.

[!INCLUDE [razor-pages-start](../../includes/RP/razor-pages-start.md)]

## Open the project

Press Ctrl+C to shut down the application.

From Visual Studio, select **File > Open**, and then select the *RazorPagesMovie.csproj* file.

### Launch the app

In Visual Studio, select **Run > Start Without Debugging** to launch the app. Visual Studio starts [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel), launches a browser, and navigates to `http://localhost:5000`.

In the next tutorial, we add a model to the project.
