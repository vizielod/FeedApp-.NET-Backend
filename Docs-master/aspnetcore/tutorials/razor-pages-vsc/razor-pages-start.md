# Get started with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages in Visual Studio Code

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This tutorial teaches the basics of building an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app. We recommend you complete [Introduction to Razor Pages](xref:mvc/razor-pages/index) before starting this tutorial. Razor Pages is the recommended way to build UI for web applications in ASP.NET Core.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [](~/includes/net-core-prereqs-vscode.md)]

## Create a Razor web app

From a terminal, run the following commands:

```console
dotnet new razor -o RazorPagesMovie
cd RazorPagesMovie
dotnet run
```

The preceding commands use the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) to create and run a Razor Pages project. Open a browser to http://localhost:5000 to view the application.

[!INCLUDE [razor-pages-start](../../includes/RP/razor-pages-start.md)]

## Open the project

Press Ctrl+C to shut down the application.

From Visual Studio Code (VS Code), select **File > Open Folder**, and then select the *RazorPagesMovie* folder.

- Select **Yes** to the **Warn** message "Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'RazorPagesMovie'. Add them?"
- Select **Restore** to the **Info** message "There are unresolved dependencies".

### Launch the app

Press Ctrl+F5 to start the app without debugging. Alternatively, from the **Debug** menu, select **Start Without Debugging**.

In the next tutorial, we add a model to the project.
