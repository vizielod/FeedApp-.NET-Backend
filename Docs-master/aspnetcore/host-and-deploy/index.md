# Host and deploy ASP.NET Core

In general, to deploy an ASP.NET Core app to a hosting environment:

* Publish the app to a folder on the hosting server.
* Set up a process manager that starts the app when requests arrive and restarts the app after it crashes or the server reboots.
* If configuration of a reverse proxy is desired, set up a reverse proxy that forwards requests to the app.

## Publish to a folder

The [dotnet publish](/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-publish) CLI command compiles app code and copies the files needed to run the app into a *publish* folder. When deploying from Visual Studio, the [dotnet publish](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) step happens automatically before the files are copied to the deployment destination.

### Folder contents

The *publish* folder contains *.exe* and *.dll* files for the app, its dependencies, and optionally the .NET runtime.

A .NET Core app can be published as *self-contained* or *framework-dependent* app. If the app is self-contained, the *.dll* files that contain the .NET runtime are included in the *publish* folder. If the app is framework-dependent, the .NET runtime files aren't included because the app has a reference to a version of .NET that's installed on the server. The default deployment model is framework-dependent. For more information, see [.NET Core application deployment](/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/index).

In addition to *.exe* and *.dll* files, the *publish* folder for an ASP.NET Core app typically contains configuration files, static assets, and MVC views. For more information, see [Directory structure](xref:host-and-deploy/directory-structure).

## Set up a process manager

An ASP.NET Core app is a console app that must be started when a server boots and restarted if it crashes. To automate starts and restarts, a process manager is required. The most common process managers for ASP.NET Core are:

* Linux
  * [Nginx](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)
  * [Apache](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-apache)
* Windows
  * [IIS](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index)
  * [Windows Service](xref:host-and-deploy/windows-service)

## Set up a reverse proxy

# [ASP.NET Core 2.x](#tab/aspnetcore2x)

If the app uses the [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) web server, [Nginx](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-nginx), [Apache](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-apache), or [IIS](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index) can be used as a reverse proxy server. A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the Internet and forwards them to Kestrel after some preliminary handling.

Either configuration&mdash;with or without a reverse proxy server&mdash;is a valid and supported hosting configuration for ASP.NET Core 2.0 or later apps. For more information, see [When to use Kestrel with a reverse proxy](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#when-to-use-kestrel-with-a-reverse-proxy).

# [ASP.NET Core 1.x](#tab/aspnetcore1x)

If the app uses the [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) web server and will be exposed to the Internet, use [Nginx](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-nginx), [Apache](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-apache), or [IIS](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index) as a reverse proxy server. A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the Internet and forwards them to Kestrel after some preliminary handling. The main reason for using a reverse proxy is security. For more information, see [When to use Kestrel with a reverse proxy](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel?tabs=aspnetcore1x#when-to-use-kestrel-with-a-reverse-proxy).

## Proxy server and load balancer scenarios

Additional configuration might be required for apps hosted behind proxy servers and load balancers. Without additional configuration, an app might not have access to the scheme (HTTP/HTTPS) and the remote IP address where a request originated. For more information, see [Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers](xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer).

## Using Visual Studio and MSBuild to automate deployment

Deployment often requires additional tasks besides copying the output from [dotnet publish](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) to a server. For example, extra files might be required or excluded from the *publish* folder. Visual Studio uses MSBuild for web deployment, and MSBuild can be customized to do many other tasks during deployment. For more information, see [Publish profiles in Visual Studio](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles) and the [Using MSBuild and Team Foundation Build](http://msbuildbook.com/) book.

By using [the Publish Web feature](xref:tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs) or [built-in Git support](xref:host-and-deploy/azure-apps/azure-continuous-deployment), apps can be deployed directly from Visual Studio to the Azure App Service. Visual Studio Team Services supports [continuous deployment to Azure App Service](/vsts/build-release/apps/cd/azure/aspnet-core-to-azure-webapp?tabs=vsts).

## Publishing to Azure

See [Publish an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure App Service using Visual Studio](xref:tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs) for instructions on how to publish an app to Azure using Visual Studio. The app can also be published to Azure from the [command line](xref:tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-cli).

## Additional resources

For information on using Docker as a hosting environment, see [Host ASP.NET Core apps in Docker](xref:host-and-deploy/docker/index).
