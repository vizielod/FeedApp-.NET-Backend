# Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers

By [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex) and [Chris Ross](https://github.com/Tratcher)

In the recommended configuration for ASP.NET Core, the app is hosted using IIS/ASP.NET Core Module, Nginx, or Apache. Proxy servers, load balancers, and other network appliances often obscure information about the request before it reaches the app:

* When HTTPS requests are proxied over HTTP, the original scheme (HTTPS) is lost and must be forwarded in a header.
* Because an app receives a request from the proxy and not its true source on the Internet or corporate network, the originating client IP address must also be forwarded in a header.

This information may be important in request processing, for example in redirects, authentication, link generation, policy evaluation, and client geoloation.

## Forwarded headers

By convention, proxies forward information in HTTP headers.

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| X-Forwarded-For | Holds information about the client that initiated the request and subsequent proxies in a chain of proxies. This parameter may contain IP addresses (and, optionally, port numbers). In a chain of proxy servers, the first parameter indicates the client where the request was first made. Subsequent proxy identifiers follow. The last proxy in the chain isn't in the list of parameters. The last proxy's IP address, and optionally a port number, are available as the remote IP address at the transport layer. |
| X-Forwarded-Proto | The value of the originating scheme (HTTP/HTTPS). The value may also be a list of schemes if the request has traversed multiple proxies. |
| X-Forwarded-Host | The original value of the Host header field. Usually, proxies don't modify the Host header. See [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-0787](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/295) for information on an elevation-of-privileges vulnerability that affects systems where the proxy doesn't validate or restict Host headers to known good values. |

The Forwarded Headers Middleware, from the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides/) package, reads these headers and fills in the associated fields on [HttpContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpcontext). 

The middleware updates:

* [HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.connectioninfo.remoteipaddress) &ndash; Set using the `X-Forwarded-For` header value. Additional settings influence how the middleware sets `RemoteIpAddress`. For details, see the [Forwarded Headers Middleware options](#forwarded-headers-middleware-options).
* [HttpContext.Request.Scheme](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.scheme) &ndash; Set using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header value.
* [HttpContext.Request.Host](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.host) &ndash; Set using the `X-Forwarded-Host` header value.

Note that not all network appliances add the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers without additional configuration. Consult your appliance manufacturer's guidance if the proxied requests don't contain these headers when they reach the app.

Forwarded Headers Middleware [default settings](#forwarded-headers-middleware-options) can be configured. The default settings are:

* There is only *one proxy* between the app and the source of the requests.
* Only loopback addresses are configured for known proxies and known networks.

## IIS/IIS Express and ASP.NET Core Module

Forwarded Headers Middleware is enabled by default by IIS Integration Middleware when the app is run behind IIS and the ASP.NET Core Module. Forwarded Headers Middleware is activated to run first in the middleware pipeline with a restricted configuration specific to the ASP.NET Core Module due to trust concerns with forwarded headers (for example, [IP spoofing](https://www.iplocation.net/ip-spoofing)). The middleware is configured to forward the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers and is restricted to a single localhost proxy. If additional configuration is required, see the [Forwarded Headers Middleware options](#forwarded-headers-middleware-options).

## Other proxy server and load balancer scenarios

Outside of using IIS Integration Middleware, Forwarded Headers Middleware isn't enabled by default. Forwarded Headers Middleware must be enabled for an app to process forwarded headers with [UseForwardedHeaders](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersextensions.useforwardedheaders). After enabling the middleware if no [ForwardedHeadersOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions) are specified to the middleware, the default [ForwardedHeadersOptions.ForwardedHeaders](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions.forwardedheaders) are [ForwardedHeaders.None](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.httpoverrides.forwardedheaders).

Configure the middleware with [ForwardedHeadersOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions) to forward the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers in `Startup.ConfigureServices`. Invoke the [UseForwardedHeaders](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersextensions.useforwardedheaders) method in `Startup.Configure` before calling other middleware:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();
    
    services.Configure<ForwardedHeadersOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ForwardedHeaders = 
            ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto;
    });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseForwardedHeaders();

    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    }

    app.UseStaticFiles();
    // In ASP.NET Core 1.x, replace the following line with: app.UseIdentity();
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseMvc();
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If no [ForwardedHeadersOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions) are specified in `Startup.ConfigureServices` or directly to the extension method with [UseForwardedHeaders(IApplicationBuilder, ForwardedHeadersOptions)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersextensions.useforwardedheaders?view=aspnetcore-2.0#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Builder_ForwardedHeadersExtensions_UseForwardedHeaders_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Builder_IApplicationBuilder_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Builder_ForwardedHeadersOptions_), the default headers to forward are [ForwardedHeaders.None](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.httpoverrides.forwardedheaders). The [ForwardedHeadersOptions.ForwardedHeaders](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions.forwardedheaders) property must be configured with the headers to forward.

## Forwarded Headers Middleware options

[ForwardedHeadersOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions) control the behavior of the Forwarded Headers Middleware:

```csharp
services.Configure<ForwardedHeadersOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ForwardLimit = 2;
    options.KnownProxies.Add(IPAddress.Parse("127.0.10.1"));
    options.ForwardedForHeaderName = "X-Forwarded-For-Custom-Header-Name";
});
```

## Scenarios and use cases

### When it isn't possible to add forwarded headers and all requests are secure

In some cases, it might not be possible to add forwarded headers to the requests proxied to the app. If the proxy is enforcing that all public external requests are HTTPS, the scheme can be manually set in `Startup.Configure` before using any type of middleware:

```csharp
app.Use((context, next) =>
{
    context.Request.Scheme = "https";
    return next();
});
```

This code can be disabled with an environment variable or other configuration setting in a development or staging environment.

### Deal with path base and proxies that change the request path

Some proxies pass the path intact but with an app base path that should be removed so that routing works properly. [UsePathBaseExtensions.UsePathBase](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.usepathbaseextensions.usepathbase) middleware splits the path into [HttpRequest.Path](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.path) and the app base path into [HttpRequest.PathBase](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.pathbase).

If `/foo` is the app base path for a proxy path passed as `/foo/api/1`, the middleware sets `Request.PathBase` to `/foo` and `Request.Path` to `/api/1` with the following command:

```csharp
app.UsePathBase("/foo");
```

The original path and path base are reapplied when the middleware is called again in reverse. For more information on middleware order processing, see [Middleware](xref:fundamentals/middleware/index).

If the proxy trims the path (for example, forwarding `/foo/api/1` to `/api/1`), fix redirects and links by setting the request's [PathBase](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.pathbase) property:

```csharp
app.Use((context, next) =>
{
    context.Request.PathBase = new PathString("/foo");
    return next();
});
```

If the proxy is adding path data, discard part of the path to fix redirects and links by using [StartsWithSegments(PathString, PathString)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.pathstring.startswithsegments#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_PathString_StartsWithSegments_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_PathString_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_PathString__) and assigning to the [Path](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.path) property:

```csharp
app.Use((context, next) =>
{
    if (context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/foo", out var remainder))
    {
        context.Request.Path = remainder;
    }

    return next();
});
```

## Troubleshoot

When headers aren't forwarded as expected, enable [logging](xref:fundamentals/logging/index). If the logs don't provide sufficient information to troubleshoot the problem, enumerate the request headers received by the server. The headers can be written to an app response using inline middleware:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, ILoggerFactory loggerfactory)
{
    app.Run(async (context) =>
    {
        context.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";

        // Request method, scheme, and path
        await context.Response.WriteAsync(
            $"Request Method: {context.Request.Method}{Environment.NewLine}");
        await context.Response.WriteAsync(
            $"Request Scheme: {context.Request.Scheme}{Environment.NewLine}");
        await context.Response.WriteAsync(
            $"Request Path: {context.Request.Path}{Environment.NewLine}");

        // Headers
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Request Headers:{Environment.NewLine}");

        foreach (var header in context.Request.Headers)
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync($"{header.Key}: " +
                $"{header.Value}{Environment.NewLine}");
        }

        await context.Response.WriteAsync(Environment.NewLine);

        // Connection: RemoteIp
        await context.Response.WriteAsync(
            $"Request RemoteIp: {context.Connection.RemoteIpAddress}");
    }
}
```

Ensure that the X-Forwarded-* headers are received by the server with the expected values. If there are multiple values in a given header, note Forwarded Headers Middleware processes headers in reverse order from right to left.

The request's original remote IP must match an entry in the `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` lists before X-Forwarded-For is processed. This limits header spoofing by not accepting forwarders from untrusted proxies.
