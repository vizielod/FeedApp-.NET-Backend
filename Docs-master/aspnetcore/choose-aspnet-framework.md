# Choose between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core

No matter the web app you're creating, ASP.NET has a solution for you: from enterprise web apps targeting Windows Server, to small microservices targeting Linux containers, and everything in between.

## ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based web apps on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## ASP.NET

ASP.NET is a mature framework that provides all the services needed to build enterprise-grade, server-based web apps on Windows.

## Framework selection

Review the table below to determine which framework is most appropriate for your needs.
