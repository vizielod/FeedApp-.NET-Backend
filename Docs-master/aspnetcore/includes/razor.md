This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC web development with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core 2.0, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend you try the [Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) tutorial before the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

* Is the preferred approach for new application development.
* Is easier to follow.
* Covers more features.

If you choose this tutorial over the [Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) version, please tell us why in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/issues/6146).
