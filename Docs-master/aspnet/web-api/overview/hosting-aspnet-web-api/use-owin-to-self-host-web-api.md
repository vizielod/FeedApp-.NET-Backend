Use OWIN to Self-Host ASP.NET Web API 2
====================
by [Kanchan Mehrotra](https://twitter.com/kanchanmeh)

> This tutorial shows how to host ASP.NET Web API in a console application, using OWIN to self-host the Web API framework.
> 
> [Open Web Interface for .NET](http://owin.org) (OWIN) defines an abstraction between .NET web servers and web applications. OWIN decouples the web application from the server, which makes OWIN ideal for self-hosting a web application in your own process, outside of IIS.
> 
> ## Software versions used in the tutorial
> 
> 
> - [Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-downloads) (also works with Visual Studio 2012)
> - Web API 2


> [!NOTE]

## Create a Console Application

On the **File** menu, click **New**, then click **Project**. From **Installed Templates**, under Visual C#, click **Windows** and then click **Console Application**. Name the project "OwinSelfhostSample" and click **OK**.

## Add the Web API and OWIN Packages

From the **Tools** menu, click **Library Package Manager**, then click **Package Manager Console**. In the Package Manager Console window, enter the following command:

`Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.OwinSelfHost`

This will install the WebAPI OWIN selfhost package and all the required OWIN packages.

## Configure Web API for Self-Host

In Solution Explorer, right click the project and select **Add** / **Class** to add a new class. Name the class `Startup`.

Replace all of the boilerplate code in this file with the following:

[!code-csharp[Main](use-owin-to-self-host-web-api/samples/sample1.cs)]

## Add a Web API Controller

Next, add a Web API controller class. In Solution Explorer, right click the project and select **Add** / **Class** to add a new class. Name the class `ValuesController`.

Replace all of the boilerplate code in this file with the following:

[!code-csharp[Main](use-owin-to-self-host-web-api/samples/sample2.cs)]

## Start the OWIN Host and Make a Request Using HttpClient

Replace all of the boilerplate code in the Program.cs file with the following:

[!code-csharp[Main](use-owin-to-self-host-web-api/samples/sample3.cs)]

## Running the Application

To run the application, press F5 in Visual Studio. The output should look like the following:

[!code-console[Main](use-owin-to-self-host-web-api/samples/sample4.cmd)]
