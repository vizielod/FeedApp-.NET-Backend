## Overview

If you are new to ASP.NET Web Forms but have familiarity with programming concepts, you have the right tutorial. If you are already familiar with ASP.NET Web Forms, you can benefit from this tutorial series by the new features available in ASP.NET 4.5. If you are unfamiliar with programming concepts and ASP.NET Web Forms, see the additional tutorials provided in the Web Forms [Getting Started](../../../index.md) section on the ASP.NET Web site.

The specific **latest** ASP.NET 4.5 features provided in this Web Forms tutorial series include the following:

- A simple UI for creating projects that offer [support for multiple ASP.NET frameworks](../../../../visual-studio/overview/2013/creating-web-projects-in-visual-studio.md#add) (Web Forms, MVC, and Web API).
- [Bootstrap](../../../../visual-studio/overview/2013/creating-web-projects-in-visual-studio.md#bootstrap), a layout and theming framework that provides responsive design and theming capabilities.
- [ASP.NET Identity](../../../../identity/index.md), a new ASP.NET membership system that works the same in all ASP.NET frameworks and works with web hosting software other than IIS.
- [Entity Framework 6](https://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ef.aspx), an update to the Entity Framework which allows you retrieve and manipulate data as strongly typed objects, access data asynchronously, handle transient connection faults, and log SQL statements.

For a complete list of ASP.NET 4.5 features, see [ASP.NET and Web Tools for Visual Studio 2013 Release Notes](../../../../visual-studio/overview/2013/release-notes.md).

### The Wingtip Toys Sample Application

The following screen shots provide a quick view of the ASP.NET Web forms application that you will create in this tutorial series. When you run the application from Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web, you will see the following web Home page.

![Wingtip Toys - Default page](introduction-and-overview/_static/image1.png)

You can register as a new user, or log in as an existing user. Navigation is provided at the top for each product category by retrieving the available products from the database.

By selecting the Products link, you will be able to see a list of all available products.

![Wingtip Toys - Products](introduction-and-overview/_static/image2.png)

You can also see individual product details by selecting any of the listed products.

![Wingtip Toys - Product Details](introduction-and-overview/_static/image3.png)

As a user, you can register and log in using the default functionality of the Web Forms template. This tutorial also explains how to login using an existing Gmail account. Additionally, you can login as the administrator to add and remove products from the database.

![Wingtip Toys - Log in](introduction-and-overview/_static/image4.png)

Once you have logged in as a user, you can add products to the shopping cart and checkout with PayPal. Note that this sample application is designed to function with PayPal's developer sandbox. No actual money transaction will take place.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/downloads#vs) or [Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/downloads#express-web). The .NET Framework is installed automatically.

This tutorial series uses Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web. You can use either Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web or Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 to complete this tutorial series.

> [!NOTE] 
> 
> Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web will often be referred to as Visual Studio throughout this tutorial series.


If you already have a Visual Studio version installed, the installation process will install Visual Studio 2013 or Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web next to the existing version. Sites that you created in earlier versions can be opened in Visual Studio 2013 and continue to open in previous versions.

> [!NOTE] 
> 
> This walkthrough assumes that you selected the *Web Development* collection of settings the first time that you started Visual Studio. For more information, see [How to: Select Web Development Environment Settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff521558.aspx).


## Download the Sample Application

After installing the prerequisites, you are ready to begin creating the new Web project that is presented in this tutorial series. If you would like to **optionally** run the sample application that this tutorial series creates, you can download it from the MSDN Samples site. This download contains the following:

- The sample application in the *WingtipToys* folder.
- The resources used to create the sample application in the *WingtipToys-Assets* folder in the *WingtipToys* folder.

#### Download the file from MSDN Samples site:

[Getting Started with ASP.NET 4.5 Web Forms and Visual Studio 2013 - Wingtip Toys](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=389434&clcid=0x409) (C#) 

The download is a <em>.zip</em> file. To see the completed project that this tutorial series creates, find and select the <em>C#</em>folder in the <em>.zip</em> file. Save the <em>C#</em> folderto the folder you use to work with Visual Studio 2013 projects. By default, the Visual Studio 2013 projects folder is the following:

<strong>C:\Users&#92;</strong><strong><em>&lt;username&gt;</em></strong><strong>\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects</strong>

Rename the ***C#*** folder to ***WingtipToys***.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a folder named *WingtipToys* in your Projects folder, temporarily rename that existing folder before renaming the *C#* folder to *WingtipToys*.


To run the completed project, open the *WingtipToys* folder and double-click the *WingtipToys.sln* file. Visual Studio 2013 will open the project. Next, right-click the *Default.aspx* file in the Solution Explorer window and click View In Browser from the right-click menu.
