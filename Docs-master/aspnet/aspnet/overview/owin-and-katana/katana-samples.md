Katana Samples
====================
by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)

## Katana Samples

**ASP.NET Routes Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/AspNetRoutes/ReadMe.txt)  
In some applications you will want to hook up OWIN components in the Asp.Net route table side by side with non-OWIN components. This sample shows how to use the RouteCollection extension methods MapOwinPath and MapOwinRoute provided by Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb.

**Branching Pipelines Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/BranchingPipelines/ReadMe.txt)  
OWIN request processing pipelines do not need to be linear, they can be branched to process requests in different ways. This sample shows how to construct a branching pipeline based on request paths or other request data such as headers. These components are available in the Microsoft.Owin.Mapping nuget package.

**Custom Server Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/CustomServer/MyCustomServer/CustomServer.cs)   
Shows how to use a custom OWIN server when self-hosting OWIN.

**Embedded Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/Embedded/ReadMe.txt)  
Some OWIN servers can be run inside of your own process (&quot;self-hosted&quot;). This sample shows how to start an OWIN application using the tools provided by the Microsoft.Owin.Hosting nuget package.

**HelloWorld Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/HelloWorld/ReadMe.txt)  
OWIN is a HTTP server API abstraction that enables application portability across various servers. This sample demonstrates how to write a Hello World application using some **simple wrappers** around the raw OWIN abstraction and run it on a web server like ASP.NET.

**Hello World Raw OWIN Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/HelloWorldRawOwin/ReadMe.txt)  
This sample demonstrates how to write a Hello World application using the **raw** OWIN abstraction and run it on a web server like Asp.Net.

**SignalR Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/SignalR/Program.cs)  
Shows how to self-host SignalR using OWIN / Katana. For more info about self-hosting SignalR, see [Tutorial: SignalR Self-Host](../../../signalr/overview/deployment/tutorial-signalr-self-host.md).

**Static Files Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/StaticFilesSample/Startup.cs)   
Shows how to support HTTP requests for static files using OWIN / Katana.

**Web API** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/WebApi/ReadMe.txt)   
This sample shows how to host OWIN in IIS and add Web API to the OWIN pipeline.

**Web Socket Sample** | [Source Code](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/Katana/WebSocketSample/WebSocketServer/Startup.cs)   
Shows how to support Web Sockets in OWIN by using the [System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocket](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.websockets.websocket(v=vs.110).aspx) class.
